# Frontend Instructions

The frontend uses React with the compiler, TailwindCSS, TanStack Router, Shadcn, Clerk auth, Vite, Playwright, and Storybook.

## Structure

| Directory        | Description                                                                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/routes`     | File-based TanStack routes. Routes only route and import pages from `src/features`. |
| `src/features`   | Vertical feature slices.                                                            |
| `src/components` | Shared design-system components.                                                    |
| `src/lib/api`    | API client and live hooks. Callers do not depend directly on tRPC or React Query.   |
| `.storybook`     | Storybook configuration. Stories live next to their components.                     |
| `playwright`     | End-to-end tests using page objects and Clerk authentication.                       |

## Commands

- `pnpm --filter frontend e2e`: run local end-to-end tests.
- `pnpm --filter frontend checks`: run all frontend quality checks.

## End-to-end Tests

- Structure tests with descriptive `test.step()` blocks reflecting user behavior. Do not use AAA sections.
- Page objects own selectors, reusable interactions, and routes. Tests use intent-revealing methods such as `page.navbar.signOut()`; navigation methods return the destination page object.
- Use component objects for cohesive shared UI, not individual elements.
- Expose semantic locators for assertions only. Tests must not interact with locators directly; add a page-object method instead.
- Keep all `expect` calls and `test.step()` blocks in tests. Page objects expose actions and observable state, not assertions.
- Prefer locator assertions over boolean state methods for automatic waiting and diagnostics.
- Prefer role-based locators; use test IDs only when no stable semantic locator exists.

## React Gotchas

- React Compiler is enabled. Use `useMemo` or `useCallback` only when the compiler cannot handle the case.
- Extract repeated or complex JSX into local components, even when they remain in the same file.
